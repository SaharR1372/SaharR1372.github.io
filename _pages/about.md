👩‍💻 I'm a forth-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://lcsee.statler.wvu.edu/) at West Virginia University, under the supervision of [Professor Nasrabadi](https://nassernasrabadi.faculty.wvu.edu/). 

📚 🔬 💡 My research lies at the intersection of **machine learning** and **computer vision**, with a particular focus on:

* Deep Representation Learning
* Generative models
* Face Recognition 
* Dataset Distillation

📈 🌱 I am eager to apply my experience in the real-worlds problems and am actively seeking an internship where I can learn, gain insights, and further enhance my skills.

👥 I am also passionate about assisting others on their journey in the world of Machine Learning and academia.
