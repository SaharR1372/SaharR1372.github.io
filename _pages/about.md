üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I'm a third-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at West Virginia University, under the supervision of Professor Nasrabadi.

üìö My research interests primarily lie in machine learning and computer vision, with recent works focusing on:

* Face recognition
* Face super-resolution
* Head pose estimation
* Dataset distillation
* Functional and structural age-related human brain changes

üìΩÔ∏è I am keen on applying my experience in the field of health science. I am also passionate about assisting others on their journey in the world of Machine Learning and academia.
