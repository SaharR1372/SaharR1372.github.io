üë©‚Äçüíª I'm a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://lcsee.statler.wvu.edu/) at West Virginia University, under the supervision of [Professor Nasrabadi](https://nassernasrabadi.faculty.wvu.edu/). 

üìö üî¨ üí° My research interests primarily lie in machine learning and computer vision, with recent works focusing on:

* Representation learning
* Face recognition
* Dataset distillation
* Face super-resolution
* Head pose estimation
* Functional and structural age-related human brain changes

üìà üå± I am eager to apply my experience in the real-worlds problems and am actively seeking an internship where I can learn, gain insights, and further enhance my skills.

üë• I am also passionate about assisting others on their journey in the world of Machine Learning and academia.
