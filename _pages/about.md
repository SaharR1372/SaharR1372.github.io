👩‍💻 I'm a forth-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://lcsee.statler.wvu.edu/) at West Virginia University, under the supervision of [Professor Nasrabadi](https://nassernasrabadi.faculty.wvu.edu/). I am currently interning at the Mayo Clinic, where I work on medical image analysis.

📚 🔬 💡 My research interests:

* Computer vision
* Deep Representation Learning
* Medical image analysis
* Machine Learning
* Generative models


📈 🌱 I am eager to apply my experience to real-world problems and continually seek opportunities to gain insights, expand my expertise, and further enhance my skills in  computer vision and machine learning.
